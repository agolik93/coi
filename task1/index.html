              On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and
              dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of
              pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot
              foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
              blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of
              will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and
              pain.
